      <p>
        All people, and most animals, have to get washed up. My mom and dad take
        a shower to get clean. Sometimes I see them wash their hands and face at
        the sink. Even my friend’s dog gets washed. Getting clean helps me smell
        nice. It helps me to calm my body down to go to sleep. It helps me to
        stay healthy. Sometimes I don’t like to wash up. When I wash my face,
        the water feels overwhelming on my face. Sometimes the water is too hot
        or too cold. The soap sometimes smells funny and feels slick on my face.
        When I get out of the shower or tub, sometimes I feel cold and get the
        chills.
