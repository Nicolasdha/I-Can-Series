      <p>
        When it is time to wash up, I can ask for help getting the water
        temperature just right. Some people use wash cloths to wash their face
        because it is soft and easier to rinse off with. I can try to wash my
        face all by myself and my parent can just tidy up where I missed. When I
        am done washing up, I can ask for a story or song that will help me calm
        down. When it is time to wash up, I can either wash my hands and face or
        take a shower or bath like my parents tell me to. I can get my body
        clean so that I can stay healthy and clean. I CAN get washed up before
        bed!
