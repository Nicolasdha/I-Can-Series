        Sound machine noises can keep me from hearing the noises outside my
        room. There are so many choices, rain sounds, ocean sounds, jungle
        sounds, white sound. Maybe I can choose my nighttime story and noise
        before going to bed. When it is time to fall asleep, I can keep my body
        calm. I can ask for a night light. I can choose a sleep story or
        meditation and a sleep sound to help my brain stay calm. I can snuggle
        into my covers and hug my stuffed animal. When my parents tuck me in a
        say goodnight, close my eyes and go to sleep. Tomorrow I will wake up
        with energy for the new day! I CAN go to sleep!
