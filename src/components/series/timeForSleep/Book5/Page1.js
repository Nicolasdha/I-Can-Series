      <h1>I can get my clean pajamas on before bed.</h1>
      <p>
        When it is time or bed, my whole family changes into their clean
        pajamas. Some people wear a t-shirt and shorts. Some wear a sweatshirt
        and sweat pants. Some wear nightgowns. Most people wear matching pajamas
        with cute pictures or words on them that help them feel sleepy. It is
        nice to change into clean pajamas to get into bed. Then I smell clean
        and don’t get the dirt from the day into my bed while I sleep. I wonder
        why animals don’t wear pajamas? I don’t always like to put on my
        pajamas. Sometimes I want to wear the same clothes that I wore all day.
        It seems too hard to change.
