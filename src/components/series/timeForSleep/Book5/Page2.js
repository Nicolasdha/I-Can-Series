      <p>
        I feel comfortable in what I am wearing. Sometimes I donâ€™t like pulling
        my shirts over my head because it tugs on my face and hair. Sometimes I
        like one pair of pajamas and only want to wear that one pair over and
        over. I can ask to pick my own pajamas from my drawer. Maybe mom can lay
        out two choices every night for me to choose from. I can tell my parents
        why I like certain pajamas or clothes and we can find more choices like
        my favorites. When it is time for me to get ready for bed, I can pick a
        pair of clean pajamas and put them on so that I am clean and fresh for
        sleeping. I CAN get my clean pajamas on before bed!
