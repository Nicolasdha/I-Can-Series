      <p>
        I love to play at night before bed. We have so much fun. Sometimes we
        read books. Sometimes we play with toys. Sometimes we watch a show on
        tv. All living things need sleep. It gives us energy to have fun the
        next day. It helps me digest my food. It gives my body time to grow. My
        friends sleep. My family sleeps. Even animals sleep! I don’t always like
        to stop playing when it is time to get ready for bed. I want to keep
        playing. I don’t want to miss out on the fun. Sometimes I don’t feel
        tired.
