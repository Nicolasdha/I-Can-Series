        When it is time to get ready for bed, I can ask my parents to give me a
        10 minute and 5 minute warning. I can ask for my favorite song while I
        get my toys put away. I can pretend to be my favorite animal while I get
        ready. I can ask to have a book or song before bed if I get ready in a
        reasonable amount of time. When my parents tell me it is time to get
        ready for bed, I can ask for help to pick up my toys and get my things
        ready for going to bed. I CAN stop playing to get ready for bed!
