        Sometimes the dark feels scary. My brain does not always stop thinking
        and worrying when I try to calm down and go to sleep. When it is time to
        calm down and get into bed, I can ask my parents for my favorite stuffed
        animal. Sometimes heavy things, like blankets or toys, help my body calm
        down. I can ask for a nightlight or a light outside my room to be left
        on so that I don’t feel afraid of the dark. When it is time to go to
        bed, I can get ready and get in bed to start calming down and sleep. I
        can choose my sound and my story. I can ask for a light at night so that
        I don’t feel afraid of the dark. I can calm my body down to get some
        rest. I CAN get in bed and get tucked in!
