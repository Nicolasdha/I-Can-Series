      <p>
        When it is time to go to sleep, my parents get in bed, turn out the
        lights, snuggle in their blankets and go to sleep. Even the birds in the
        trees fluff up and get all comfortable in their nests and close their
        eyes to go to sleep at night. It is nice to get my body calm and
        comfortable for it to rest so that I have energy tomorrow. My friend at
        school uses a night light at nighttime, but my cousin says he leaves the
        bathroom light on outside his door at night. I love to play and read and
        run around and watch tv. It can be hard to calm down and take a break. I
        just want to keep moving and playing. Sleeping sometimes seems boring. I
        donâ€™t like being alone in my bed.
