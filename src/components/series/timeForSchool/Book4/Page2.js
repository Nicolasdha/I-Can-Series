      <p>
        I can ask my parent to put some detangling cream or leave in
        conditioner. Maybe I can smell a few to decide which one I like best. If
        they brush from the very bottom first, the tangles come out more easily
        and it doesnâ€™t hurt. It also helps to have my hair a little wet before
        brushing it. I can ask for my favorite song or story while I get my hair
        brushed. When it is time for me to have my hair brushed, I can stay calm
        so that my hair looks clean and nice and stays out of my face. I CAN get
        my hair brushed!
