      <h1>I can get my hair brushed.</h1>
      <p>
        My mom brushes her hair after she gets out of the shower. My dad brushes
        his hair when he gets ready in the morning. Even my neighbor’s dog gets
        her fur brushed. Having brushed out hair helps me to look neat and
        clean. It also helps my hair to grow and stay healthy. Having it brushed
        keeps it out of my face while I try to do my work or play during the
        day. When I need my hair brushed, I don’t always like it. Sometimes I
        have tangles and it hurts when it gets brushed. Once I had food
        something sticky stuck in my hair. When I brushed it, it got stuck in
        the brush and really hurt. It felt like it was pulling my hair out.
        Sometimes it seems like it takes a long time for my hair to get brushed.
