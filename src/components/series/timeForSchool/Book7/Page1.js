      <p>
        All living things have to sleep. My parents sleep. My neighbors sleep.
        My teachers sleep. Even my friends sleep. Sleep is very important for
        our mind and body. It gives us a chance to let our bodies digest our
        food, rest all of our organs and brain and get refreshed for tomorrow. I
        donâ€™t always like to sleep at night. I would rather be playing.
        Sometimes I want to be with my parents and friends. It is hard to calm
        down my body and brain at night. When I try to fall asleep, my body
        feels tense and like it wants to get up and run around. Weighted items,
        like stuffed animals and blankets, can help get my body calmed down.
        Meditation and sleep stories can also be very helpful to calm my body
        down. There are several apps, like Moshi and Headspace, that my parent
        can put on in my room to help me calm down and get comfortable.
